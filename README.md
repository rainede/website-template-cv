## :two: Instructions

There options for you to generate your cv here..

### Option 1 - Manually update your CV
Edit the index.html file


### Option 2 - Generate the content with your CV
For a detailed explanation of the data structure, how to load the data from the file etc., pelase see the section [Working with the Data](#working-with-the-data).

In order to start making queries, you need a bit of preparation to get your local environment up and running.

#### :floppy_disk: Preparing your local environment

1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    $ git clone git@github.com:raineydavid/website-template-cv.git
    ```

2. Move into the `website-template-cv` directory: `$ cd website-template-cv`

3. The file structure should look something like the diagram below.

    ```txt
    website-template-cv/
        README.md
        ...
    ```

    **:exclamation:IMPORTANT:exclamation:** The `.env` file is _ignored_ in `.gitignore` file in the root of the project. This means that it will not get tracked by `git`, and hence will not be checked into your commits. This is important for security purposes, as you _never_ want to expose your credentials to publically available spaces :no_good:
    
4. Now you're ready to make a customised template using `website-template-cv` :boom:

In the next section I explain how to use it in detail.
